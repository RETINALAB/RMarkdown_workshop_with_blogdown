## Prerequisites 


- To compile PDF documents using R, you are going to need to have LaTeX installed.

- By far the easiest way to install LaTeX on any platform is with the `tinytex` R package:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c('tinytex', 'rmarkdown'))
tinytex::install_tinytex()
# after restarting RStudio, confirm that you have LaTeX with
tinytex:::is_tinytex()
```
--

- Install the `bookdown` and `thesisdown` packages.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}

if (!require("remotes")) 
  install.packages("remotes", repos = "https://cran.rstudio.org")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
remotes::install_github("ismayc/thesisdown")
```

- Note that {thesisdown} is not available on CRAN at the moment and that’s why `install.packages("thesisdown")` won’t work.

# Tip

### You may need to restart RStudio at this point for the following dialog to show up.
---

File > New Project > New Directory

Then select **Thesis Project using thesisdown**
from the dropdown

```{r   out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/thesis_proj1.png")

```
---

Give your project a name and specify where you’d like the files to appear

```{r   out.width = "70%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/thesis_proj2.png")

```

`index.Rmd`: Contains your YAML (metadata) that will tell bookdown how to render your book
