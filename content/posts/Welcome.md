**This workshop website is developed and maintained by [Dr. Priyanga D. Talagala](https://prital.netlify.app/) and [Dr. Thiyanga S. Talagala](https://thiyanga.netlify.app/)**


**This hands-on workshop aims to equip participants with the fundamentals of reproducible research with R Markdown and related tools. This is designed for those who have no or little prior experience with R Markdown and who want to learn Quarto the next generation of R Markdown for publishing, including dynamic and static documents and multi-lingual programming language support.**


**The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Data Carpentry workshops. Data Carpentry's mission is to train researchers in the core data skills for efficient, shareable, and reproducible research practices.**
 
*These materials are designed and developed for a trainer-led workshop at the Research Lounge Meet on October 18, 2022, organized by the Faculty of Graduate Studies and University Library, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, but should be useful for self-guided learning as well.*
