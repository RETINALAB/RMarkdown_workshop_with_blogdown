https://www.rstudio.com/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/

ecently released version 1.0, our first stable release

After a soft launch of several months, Quarto was a major theme of this year’s RStudio Conference in late July. -->

## Quarto

```{r   out.width = "40%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quarto.jpeg")

```

- Quarto is open source.

--

- It’s not a language-specific library, but an external software application.

--

- Use Quarto with R, Python, Julia, Javascript, and many other languages to create dynamic content 
---
## Why bother with Quarto?

- Quarto is RStudio’s attempt to bring R Markdown to everyone!

--

- Unlike R Markdown, Quarto doesn’t require or depend on R.

--

- The goal of Quarto is to make the process of creating and collaborating on scientific and technical documents dramatically better.

--

- If you use more than one language, or you are on a multi-language team, you will likely find Quarto’s native support for multiple languages appealing.

---
<!-- Quarto made it much easier for Python and R users to work together-->

## Why bother with Quarto?

- Quarto combines the functionality of R Markdown, bookdown, distill, xaringan, etc. into a single consistent system with “batteries included” that reflects everything we’ve learned from R Markdown

--

- You can export Quarto documents in more than 40 different file formats including Word, OpenOffice, PowerPoint, ePub, Jira Wiki, Jupyter, Observable JS, complete websites, and ebooks. R Markdown can generate some of those, but not all.

--

- Quarto was designed to be multilingual, beginning with R, Python, Javascript, and Julia, with the idea that it will work even for languages that don’t yet exist.
---

# Getting started with Quarto

### Step 1: Install Quarto

- Because Quarto isn’t a language-specific library, you install it like any other stand-alone software. 

- You can find binary downloads for Windows, macOS, and Linux on Quarto’s [“Get Started” page](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
.

- If you’re an R user and you have an up-to-date version of RStudio, Quarto should be included by default. You don’t need to install Quarto separately.

---
# How to use RStudio with Quarto

- If you know R Markdown, a Quarto document will look familiar.

- You’ll edit code and markdown in RStudio just as you would with R Markdown, and preview the rendered document in the Viewer tab as you work.
---
# Create a Quarto document file

File > New File > Quarto Document

```{r   out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quartocmd1.png")

```
---

# Create a Quarto document file

.pull-left[
```{r   out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quartocmd2.png")

```
].pull-right[

```{r   out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quartocmd2b.png")

```

]
---

One of the biggest differences between  R Markdown and Quarto is how you set up options for code chunks.

.pull-left[

## R Markdown

-  Chunk-specific options are typically put within curly braces


```{r   out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/code1.png")

```

].pull-right[

## Quarto

- Chunk options start off with #| (“hash pipe”) and go below the curly braces for R, Python, or Julia.

```{r   out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/code2.png")

```



]
---

# Render the document

```{r   out.width = "50%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap=''}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/quartocmd3.png")

```
